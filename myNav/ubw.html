        <h1 style="font-size: 30px;">Synopsis from MyAnimeList </h1>
        <p>
            The Holy Grail War is a battle royale among seven magi who serve as Masters. Masters, through the use of the command seals they are given when they enter the war, command Heroic Spirits known as Servants to fight for them in battle. In the Fifth Holy Grail War, Rin Tohsaka is among the magi entering the competition. With her Servant, Archer, she hopes to obtain the ultimate prizeâ€”the Holy Grail, a magical artifact capable of granting its wielder any wish.
<br>
<br>
One of Rin's classmates, Emiya Shirou, accidentally enters the competition and ends up commanding a Servant of his own known as Saber. As they find themselves facing mutual enemies, Rin and Shirou decide to form a temporary alliance as they challenge their opponents in the Holy Grail War.

        <h1 style="font-size: 30px;">What is Unlimited Blade Works?</h1>
        <p>
Unlimited Blade Works is one of the three routes of the original Fate/Stay Night visual novel. 
This route focuses on the  main heroine in this route who is Rin Tohsaka, who makes a small cameo in Fate/Zero before the 4th Holy Grail War happened. This route also focuses on Rin's servant, Archer, where it goes more into detail about his backstory.
<br>
<br>
The point of view in this route is seen mostly in Rin's point of view at the start but it then transitions into Shirou's point of view as the story goes on.
