    <p>
    The Fate series is a franchise originating from the Fate/Stay Night visual novel that was released in 2004. Originally created by writer Kinoko Nasu and illustrator Takaechu Takashi, the Fate series quickly expanded into it's own franchise after the Saber route of the visual novel got adapted into an anime by Studio Deen in 2006.
    <br>
    <br>
    Spinoffs like Fate/Kaleid Prisma Illya,which is a magical girl crossover, was created and the creation of Fate/Zero, a prequel to the Fate/Stay Night series.

    <h1 style="font-size: 30px;">How to watch the Fate series</h1>
    <p>
        The chronological order of watching the Fate series goes like this:
        <br>
        <br>
        Fate/Zero > Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works > Fate/Stay Night: Heaven's Feel 
        <br>
        <br>
        I did not include the 2006 adaptation of the Fate/Stay Night Saber route and the 2010 adaptation of the Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works route as it was adapted by Studio Deen which is different from the studio who adapts the modern Fate/Stay Night series, ufotable, which then makes it hard to understand the story overall as they both have different directors and such.
