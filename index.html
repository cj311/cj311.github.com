<h2>Brief Introduction </h2>

<p>My hobbies are playing online games and watching anime. I’m a huge introvert so I most of the time just get straight to the point when I’m really embarrassed or uncomfortable when talking to someone.
    I enjoy having a conversation with people that have similar interests as me. I’m a shy but kind person. </p>

    <h2>Why did you enroll as an ICT student? Why not other track or strands?</h2>

    <p>I chose ICT because it’s somewhat related to my hobbies and interests.I can’t see myself choosing any other track or strand which is why I went with ICT.
         Another reason I chose ICT is because it presents me an opportunity to learn more about computers and prepare me for when I go to college. </p>

 <h2>What is your dream job? How do you think will this course will help you in pursuing your career?
     </h2>

     <p> As of right now, I don’t have a particular dream job.
          My goal right now is to be able to learn coding and programming so that when I am confident in myself,
           I can start looking for a job that is fun and has a reasonable salary.</p>

    <h2>To whom are you dedicating your success in finishing this course? Yourself,family,friends,special someone etc. Why?</h2>

    <p>I want to dedicate this to my family. They’ve always supported my interests and hobbies. They don’t mind that I’m an introvert or that I don’t go outside at all. 
        They love me and in return, I love them. And with that, I want to use everything that they’ve given to me to support them in the future. </p>
