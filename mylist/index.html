    <h2> Favorite Games</h2>
        <dt>Team Fortress 2 </dt>
        <dd> I have over 4,000 hours spent into this game and it was the start of my descent into the internet.</dd>
    <dt>osu!</dt>
    <dd> My favorite rhythm game as it allows me to play my favorite songs and allows me to train my reflexes for other games as well. </dd>
    <dt>Fate Grand/Order</dt>
    <dd> The first gacha game I have ever been invested in. The story is the main reason why I am so invested into this game and collecting characters is another reason as well.</dd>
    <dt> Overwatch</dt>
    <dd> A game similar to Team Fortress 2. It is also a class based shooter but instead of customizable weapons for nine characters, it has an array of characters with different sets of abilities.</dd>
    <dt> Genshin Impact</dt>
    <dd> Another gacha game that I got invested in. The character collection and the grinding for powerful artifacts is what got me invested into this game.</dd>
    <dt> Apex Legends</dt>
    <dd> My favorite battle royale game. The fast paced combat and the different weapons make this game fun. The characters are also likable with their own sets of abilities.</dd>
    <dt> Persona 5</dt>
    <dd> My favorite JRPG. This game is in my opinion, the most stylish looking JRPG game I have seen. The music is amazing, the combat is also amazing.</dd>
    <dt> Persona 5 Strikers</dt>
    <dd> A spinoff of my favorite JRPG game. In this game it becomes a Dynasty Warrior like game. The combat and music is absolutely amazing alike the first game.</dd>
    <dt> Minecraft</dt>
    <dd> The first game I have ever been invested in. This open world game allows you to be creative and interact with other people as well.</dd>
    <dt> Muse Dash</dt>
    <dd> The other rhythm game that I play. This game is a mix of aesthethically pleasing art and fun gameplay.</dd>
