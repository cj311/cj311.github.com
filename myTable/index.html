                <h2> Team Fortress 2</h2>
                <p> This is my favorite and my most played video game. It's fun because of it's 9 different classes with different customizable weapons. I play this game competitively and compete in tournaments which is also why I put alot of time in the game
                    Although the game is not getting updated, the community is still keeping it alive and making sure it thrives.

            <h2>osu!</h2>
            <p> This is my favorite rhythm game to play. There are four different game modes but I normally play osu! standard. Since all the maps are customly made by other players, most songs that I like will have a map for the song.
                This allows me to play my favorite songs and practice my hand eye coordination as well. I play this normally to warm up but I've grown to actually play the game by itself without the thought of warming up.

            <h2>Fate/Grand Order</h2>
            <p>This is my most played gacha game. At first I played this just for the collection and because I'm in the Fate fandom, but now I got hooked into the story as well.
                This game is basically collecting servants and using them in battle. I normally play this to just pass time.

            <h2>Overwatch</h2>
            <p>
          This game is similar to Team Fortress 2 except that it has many more heroes without customizable loadouts. This game unlike Team Fortress 2 encourages counterpicking against heroes and more teamplay.
          I play this game always with my friends but rarely when alone since it requires alot of teamwork.

                <h2>Apex Legends</h2>
                <p>
                    This game is my favorite battle royale game. It combines the class based shooter aspect that I loved from TF2 with the battle royale genre. There is also a plethora of guns that are fun to use. I normally don't like battle royale games but this game has me hooked because of it's fast paced shooting with different usable characters that have different sets of skills.
